# Just Show It, a Traveler Picture Dictionary

Just Show It is an app I've developed with Johann Barthel. It is on the App
Store since July 24th.

It is a _visual travel dictionary_: an image database, organized in categories,
to allow communication with people you don't share a common spoken language
with.

When traveling abroad, Just Show It help people get understood everywhere, by
everyone. A picture is worth a thousand words.

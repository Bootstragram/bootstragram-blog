Just Show It
============

Just Show It is an app I've developed with Johann Barthel. It is on the App Store since July 24th.

It is a *visual travel dictionary*: an image database, organized in categories, to allow communication with people you don't share a common spoken language with. 

When traveling abroad, Just Show It help people get understood everywhere, by everyone.

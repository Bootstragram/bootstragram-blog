Here are some random notes from the [Paris Hacker Meetup #4][meetup], hosted in
[Joshfire][joshfire]'s great hall, a couple of weeks ago.

The first talk was from [Tristan Nitot][nitot], about the relevance of Mozilla
in the web today. Mozilla's point of view is pretty straightforward: the web needs
a major non-profit actor to balance Apple/Google/Microsoft's leadership. Fair enough.
Although I left Firefox for Google Chrome about two years ago, I 100% agree with this
and keep an eye on Firefox's new releases.

Nitot also introduced and demoed [Mozilla's Boot to Gecko project][b2g]. I'm afraid Mozilla
is kind of late to give the mobile road a ride. If Nitot mentioned a great interest from
manufacturers and operators about this project (the project's homepage specifically
mentioning "Customization for OEMs &amp; Operators"), he didn't mention what would be
the interest/difference from potential end users. As a matter of fact, I see OEMs &amp;
operators as the evil actors in the mobile world (all these shitty app layers that most
non-hackers users can't get rid off) more than Apple or Google can be.

Next was [Michel Bartz][bartz] for a talk about his high-traffic web experience. The talk
was both super interesting and entertaining: thumbs up. I had heard the name of most of the
mentioned tools but have never used them. So although I can't give valuable comments of
these products, here's the list in case it might help somebody and for personal bookmarking:

- [Redis](http://redis.io/)
- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/)
- [nginx](http://nginx.org/)
- [heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)

Last but not least, Sacha Greif introduced his really interesting [*Step by Step UI Design* eBook][ebook],
an eBook explaining how to design a UI, step by step... Just realizing the title of the eBook is really good.

Random list of things mentioned during the event :

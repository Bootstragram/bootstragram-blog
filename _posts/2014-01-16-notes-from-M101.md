# Notes from M101JS MongoDB for Node.js Developers Courseware

I signed up for the online [MongoDB University](https://education.mongodb.com/) MongoDB for Node.js Developers course aka M101JS. MongoDB sounds like a promising technology and MongoDB's courseware uses EdX's excellent software that I had already used for the MIT 6.002x Electronics course so I was pretty confident of the usefulness of all this.  


**Work in Progress!** I switched from Python to Node.js and started over. I'm currently at Week 2 - BSON Introduced
{: .alert .alert-info}


## Introduction to MongoDB

MongoDB is a non relational datastore. It stores something close from JSON called [BSON](http://bsonspec.org), which stands for Binary JSON. It is schemaless.

The tradeoff to gain scalability and performance is that you have to give up joins and transactions that relational databases provide.


### CRUD

In MongoDB vocabulary:

- Create is `insert` 
- Read is `find`
- Update is `update` 
- Delete is `remove`

Table is `collection`. `_id` is created by default.


## Mongo Shell

MongoShell is basically a JavaScript interpreter. You'll be able to CRUD data but also run simple JavaScript instructions.

Features include:

- Autocompletion via the `TAB` key
- Support of `.` and `[]` notation for JavaScript objects
- Support of BSON datatypes

Connextion to the shell: mongo

Example:

    > show dbs
    > use mydb
    
    > for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) print("Hello Bootstragram");
    Hello Bootstragram
    Hello Bootstragram
    Hello Bootstragram
    
    > help
    
    > obj = { "a" : 1, "b": "hello", "c": ["apple", "tomatoes"]}
    
    > NumberInt(1)

    > NumberLong(1)

    > new Date()

    > exit


### Query Language

`_id` is returned by default with queries.
`pretty()` helps formatting answers in a readable way.
The second argument tells MongoDB the name of the fields we want to fetch.

    > db.collection.findOne()
    > db.collection.findOne({"name": "Jones"})
    > db.collection.findOne({"name": "Jones"}, {"name": true, "_id": false})
    > db.scores.find( { type: "essay", score: 50 }, { student: true, _id: false } );


### Query operators

- `{ $gt : 95 }`: greather than (\>, NOT \>=)
- `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte` are `>=`, `<` and `<=`
- `$exists` 
- `$type` (example: 2 for String)
- `$regex` (example: "^A$")

Example:

    > db.scores.find( { type: { $exists: true } } );


### Prefix Query operators

- `$or` + array 
- `$and` + array (not as useful)

Tricky : db.scores.find( { score : { $gt : 50 }, score : { $lt : 60 } } ); # only less than 60 are returned


### Querying inside arrays

- Polymorphism
- `$all : [ elem1, elem2 ]`
- `$in : [ enum1, enum2 ]` 


### Dot notation

Don't forget the double-quotes!

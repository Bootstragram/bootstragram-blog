üéÑ December is here! Like every year, it is time to watch _Home Alone_ again and
to review the progress I made as a developer over the past 12 months. Side
projects contributed the most.

## Why side projects are necessary for me

Yes, a paying job is your bread and butter. But having side projects is key to
staying ahead of the younger guns of the tech world, flexing your developer
muscles in new directions and anticipating what‚Äôs next for you at work.

Last year, I started writing [a newsletter about soccer/football][1][^1] for
people based in France. The content is pretty basic. Still, I learned so much
just setting it up, running it, and trying to automate as many steps as possible
so that each edition would take as little time as possible to write, without
compromising the quality of the content.

## Things I learned

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the things I trained on last year to run the
newsletter, in an approximative chronological order:

- [**Swift Argument Parser.**][3] Writing a CLI in Swift is now my goto solution
  when I need to write scripts. Including at work. It is so much easier to
  write, document and maintain than Shell scripts.
- [**Buttondown.**][4] This is an indie tool to bootstrap newsletters. As part
  of the side project journey, I believe it is worth exploring alternatives to
  big corporations so I skipped Mailchimp, Mailjet and similar options. While I
  really like Buttondown, I think the newsletter is now ready to grow out of it,
  and finding a better option for my needs is on the roadmap for 2023.
- [**Linode.**][5] Similarly, I didn‚Äôt want to go the AWS route. And Linode's
  interface is much clearer than AWS ‚Äî though it is not as feature rich. Linode
  got recently bought by Akamai, so I am not as attached to it as I used to be.
- [**Terraform.**][6] Infrastructure as code. I use it to create server
  instances, manage DNS for the domain names, create and manage buckets and
  keys.
- [**iCalendar RFC.**][7] Not the sexiest subject. But I had to reverse-engineer
  how calendar software behaves to get the newsletter to work the way I wanted.
  Did you know that the iOS calendar behaves differently if you serve an ICS
  file with a 2XX HTTP status code than if you serve it via a 3XX? [I did
  not][8].
- [**JSONFeed.**][9] An alternative to RSS written in JSON.
- [**Micro.blog.**][10] An alternative to Twitter. Duh.
- **Modern React web frameworks.** I explored [Next.js][11] first, then
  [Remix][12]. Both are pretty amazing.
- [**DocC.**][13] The new documentation framework by Apple. I used [Jazzy][20]
  before, but DocC ‚Äî albeit sometimes awkward to use ‚Äî is much more complete. As
  illustrated by [Simon St√∏vring's talk during FrenchKit 2022][i1], you can
  create amazing documentation with it.
- [**Xcode Cloud.**][14] First-party CI and automated distribution of apps. It
  seems to cover some common ground with Fastlane, very convenient to distribute
  the app I use to run the newsletter on my iPhone and iPad via TestFlight.
- [**TabularData.**][15] A new framework provided by Apple to organize and
  explore data.
- [**SwiftUI.**][16] I am sure you heard of it already üòâ.
- [**The Composable Architecture.**][17] A 3rd-party architecture library that
  solved all the problems that were holding me back when I first got my toes wet
  with SwiftUI.
- [**OR-Tools library.**][18] Linear optimization library available in Python
  among others. Picking the right tools to do the right job is essential. I
  found this library to act like a Microsoft Excel solver.

Each of these tools would deserve their own post. I shouldn't run out of
inspiration for this blog next year.

## The positive impacts on my paying job

### üß∞ A better set of tools I can use

Part of my job at Memo¬†Bank is to write the iOS app that serves as the 2FA for
critical operations. The app does not do much. But the things it does are
critical. Our customers depend on it to pay salaries to their employees, pay
taxes on time, and be safe with their transactions.

The app was bootstrapped with compatibility going up to iOS¬†12. Now that I got
my hands dirty with SwiftUI and _The Composable Architecture_ on my side
projects, I feel comfortable adopting them in the app for upcoming features.
That would not have been the case without the time I spent toying with them
outside of work. I made many mistakes. I rewrote things multiple times. It is
part of learning.

Could this time spent on my free time have been part of the job? Maybe. But I
also like not having to be held accountable for anything when I explore and want
to play around with new things. I do whatever I want, without having to justify
my decisions to anyone else but me. I am in complete control of every decision.
Freedom & Fun.

### ü§ó A greater empathy

I wear every possible hat running this newsletter. I am a developer, a product
manager, and a designer. I do customer support, manage the infrastructure, etc.

I get a glimpse of the struggles that every job comes with. I get reminded that
good design is hard to get right, that keeping an infrastructure up takes
effort, that making product decisions is hard. It is a useful humbling reminder
that shit is hard to get right.

## My tips and life lessons

**üß± Use a monorepo.** Over time, I realized that using a monorepo for my
projects was much more thrilling than having a million bunny projects with 5
commits each. The feeling of progress is much more satisfying.

**üèé Take shortcuts towards the fun.** If you host your code on GitHub, don't use
an organization and don't open-source what you are doing until you feel ready.
For instance, at work, you should never leave secrets in your code. On a side
project, why not? If stakes are low, leave the boring required things you write
at work behind and sprint towards the fun parts.

**‚è± How to find time for it?** Any opportunity is good to take. My wife agreed
to leave me off kids-duty on Thursday evenings. I try to write a little bit of
code everyday, and when you work remotely, the lunch break is ideal for that.
Over time, things build up and the output you get from a 5-minute slot grows.

Also, I recommend reading [these tips from Antoine van der Lee][19]. They are
great to act as a guard rail against uncontrollable impulses to try this new
thing. His point is to keep focus, realistic expectations and priorities
straight.

## Conclusion

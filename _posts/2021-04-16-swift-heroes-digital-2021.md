[Swift Heroes][5] went digital because of the Covid pandemic restricting public
gatherings. I am not the best at socializing during conferences and watching
online talks from my comfy chair is a format that I somewhat shamefully enjoyed.
Here are my notes from the talks I have watched.

Talks with ðŸŒŸ are the talks I recommend the most.

## Evolving Existing Projects With SwiftUI - [Peter Steinberger][1]

This felt like a natural follow-up to Peter's talk at [FrenchKit 2019][i1] about
[shipping a Catalyst app][2], he offered feedback on integrating small doses of
SwiftUI in a large codebase with a long history that is a mix of Objective-C and
Swift.

Here is what I'll take away from the talk:

- SwiftUI is unstable and change dramatically at each version;
- Previews can time out being _de facto_ unreliable;
- `GeometryReader` should be used as high in the hierarchy as possible;
- There are straightforward workarounds to SwiftUI limitations â€” via custom view
  modifiers for instance â€” but they should be considered as hacks with the risks
  it implies in terms of maintenance;
- Mentioned projects were:
  - [SwiftUI-Introspect][3]: helps to introspect underlying UIKit components
    from SwiftUI;
  - [SwiftUIX][4]: a project that attempts to fill the gaps that SwiftUI suffers
    from when compared to UIKit or AppKit.

## Combining SwiftUI and UIKit: AppClips and Widgets - [Anna Zharkova][6]

Widgets and AppClips are additions to iOS that come with significant
restrictions compared to what you can achieve in an app. Anna presented
workarounds against the lack of dynamism that she met while developing widgets
and app clips using bike ride maps as an example.

My main takeaway is that, since neither the keychain or local authentication can
be used in these app-derivatives, then if any of the data you would like to
present require authentication, you are out of luck.

## Letâ€™s Make That Label With CoreText - [Marcin Krzyzanowski][7] ðŸŒŸ

Marcin is working on a [Swift Studio][8] project, a Swift IDE for which he had
to dig down into the Core Text framework. I enjoyed this talk following [my own
errands on text layout customization][i2] and I intend to use the content of his
talk to address another use case: how to balance the lengths of broken lines of
text, to avoid a situation where the line can be short compared to its siblings.

## Creating Machine Learning Models With Create ML - Moritz Philip Recke, Tiago Gomes Pereira & Giovanni Monaco

This talks was presenting how to create machine learning models with convenience
using [IBM's Cloud Annotations tool][9] to create training and testing data
sets, and feeding these into the macOS [Create ML][10] app. It did sound
accessible and I intend to give it a try one day.

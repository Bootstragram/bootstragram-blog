title: "Should I renew my Scrum Master certification?"
category: blog
---

My Scrum Master certification, delivered by the Scrum Alliance, is expiring next
June 29th. I have two weeks left to decide if I want to renew it or not, being
aware that the renewal fee is \$50 a year.

Right now, I don't think I want to renew it for the following reasons:

1. The certification can be obtained with a single 2 day training: it has not a
   lot of value to me
1. In 2 years, people never got in touch with me via the Scrum Alliance website
   (90% of my new professional connections come from LinkedIn and Viadeo, 10%
   from this website)
1. \$50 a year is not that pricy in itself, but it is pricy given the benefits
   it provides

Feel free to let me know what you think on this subject but I'm going to
transition from a _Certified Scrum Master_ status ([I can prove
it][certificate]) to a _Formerly Certified Scrum Master_ status.

# Service to Activity Communication With The Android SDK

I'm an experienced iOS developer but still consider myself a noob regarding Android development. Never mind, I still want to share 
my latest experiment with the Android SDK: how to run a long operation in the background while still updating the UI regularly?
{: .lead} 


## Where AsyncTask won't do the job...

The Android SDK provides a convenient object to perform background operations that will need to provide a UI feedback: [`AsyncTask`][asynctask]. But as [Android's documentation][asynctask] says: 

> AsyncTasks should ideally be used for short operations (a few seconds at the most.)

The question then arises: what should we use when a longer background operation is needed?


## Well, guess what? It depends...

Searching for an answer to this question on services like StackOverflow ends up being more confusing than helpful. [Many questions][stackoverflow] are asked in this area but no clear answer appears. But depending on the specific aspects of each
question, many keywords appear to help getting our quest further: `Services`, `Handlers`, etc.


##  Let's give Services a try

Ideally, I wanted to find something similar to the [KVO][kvo] mechanism in iOS. 

I decided to give `Services` a try and developed a [POC][poc] you can find on [my bootstragram-android repository on GitHub][bootstragram-android].

The main reason why I picked `Services` over other solutions is that I wanted to be able to share *any kind of objects*, not only
`Serializable` and `Parcelable` ones. This constraint eliminated a solution based on a [`LocalBroadcastManager`][LocalBroadcastManager] as from my understanding, objects that can be passed with the `Intent` (ie `Extra`) have to be `Serializable` or `Parcelable`.

My objectives for this POC were:

1. Create a background operation that will live as long as my app, no less.
2. This operation must run continously and must update some kind of state at a relatively high-frequency.
3. The user must be able to get a UI representation of that state without being blocked on one activiy in particular.

Some notes about it went follow.


### The POC  Story

The pitch for the POC is as silly as can be. The app will generate in the background a new hex-string every 2 seconds. It will have to be displayed in a screen with a new color. Wow! I'm sure this app would be a hit on the Google Play Store!


### Create a Service

When you create a `Service`, you need to declare it in your app manifest. I made mine private to my app but it's not required.

{% highlight xml %}
<application ...>
    ....
    <service 
        android:name=".services.RandomEventsService" 
        android:exported="false" >
    </service>
    ....
</application>
{% endhighlight %}

The service itself is a subclass of [`IntentService`][intentservice] (which provides a convenient `onHandleIntent` method to override) doing very simple things:

{% highlight java %}
protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {
    while (true) {
        final RandomSingleton singleton = RandomSingleton.getInstance();
        singleton.increment();
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis() + 2 * 1000;
        while (System.currentTimeMillis() < endTime) {
            synchronized (this) {
                try {
                    wait(endTime - System.currentTimeMillis());
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    Log.e(TAG, "Couldn't sleep in peace", e);
                }
            }
            singleton.increment();
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The service just runs continously and wakes up every 2 seconds to update the `RandomSingleton` singleton object via the `increment()` method: objectives 1 and 2 are achieved.

Here is [the full source code][RandomEventsService].

The service is started via a button in an activity:

{% highlight java %}
public void onClick(View v) {
  Intent intent = new Intent(ServiceFeedbackActivity.this, RandomEventsService.class);
  startService(intent);
}
{% endhighlight %}


### UI Representation and Notifications

We still have objective 3 to achieve. To do so:

1. I made my `RandomSingleton` a subclass of [`ContentObservable`][contentobservable]
2. I created an activity using a subclass of [`ContentObserver`][contentobserver], observing `RandomSingleton`
3. Then I made `RandomSingleton` call `dispatchChange(...)` at the end of the `increment()` method

And that's it.


### The Result

![The app updates the UI every 2s accordingly to the new singleton state](../../assets/images/android-services-to-activity-communication.gif "The app updates the UI every 2s accordingly to the new singleton state")

## Conclusion

After a frustrating research that had made me more confused than confident about my problem, I found out that the actual 
implementation was pretty straightforward and easier to implement than I expected. 

Nevertheless, I'm still curious of feedbacks you might
have about this code and I invite you to get in touch via [GitHub][github] or [Twitter][twitter] if you want to engage a discussion about this page
(in particular if you know a better way to do a Service to UI communication).

Also, my [message in a bottle][tweet] is still out there:

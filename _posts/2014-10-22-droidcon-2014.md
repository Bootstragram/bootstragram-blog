You can watch all the videos on [the Droidcon Paris Youtube
channel][droidcon-channel] but I especially recommend these 3 talks.

## _Scaling Android Development at Twitter_

{% asset droidcon-jan-chong.png alt="Scaling Android Development at Twitter" %}

This talk by [Jan Chong][twitter-jan-chong], engineering manager at Twitter for
Android, was about how Twitter's mobile team transitioned from a 5-people team
to a 70+ contributors effort. Here are some key points from the talk.

You can watch it [here][scaling-android-development-at-twitter].

### Operations

- In 3 years, Twitter for Android went from a 8 to 12 weeks release schedule to
  1 release a week
- The key quality indicator they're following are crashed : they analyzed that
  when a user experienced a crash, his engagement would drop significantly for
  the next month (of course, they use [Crashlytics][crashlytics], that they own)
- API released for mobiles need to be supported for a loooooong time
- They baked an API mechanism to support A/B testing within their apps that does
  not require republishing
- They also have an interesting feature switch system where they remotely
  control a device/manufacturer/OS version matrix to swith features on and off,
  again to be able to tune their apps and avoir crashes without the need to
  republish

### Tools and processes

- They're using Gradle and Android Studio
- Twitter practice [dogfooding][dogfooding]
- They switched from [Robotium][robotium] to [Espresso][espresso]
- They also use [uiautomator][uiautomator]
- They use a [release train][release-train] schedule to run their and
  transitioned from a single 4-week train to two concurrent 2-weeks trains to
  reduce the gap between deadlines
- They also use a "+1/+2" code review system

title: WWDC 2019, A Basic Wish List
tags: [iOS]
---

It's [WWDC Wish List Season][1]. Here is mine. Back to basics.

In the last week or so, I've experienced 3 different obvious bugs using 3
different Apple products. If you ask me, my top item for a WWDC wish list would
be: _let bring attentions to details back_!

## #1. The iPad bug: recently used emojis

Here is a screenshot of my frequently used emojis:

Six duplicates and I don't remember ever using this shower emoji ðŸš¿.

## #2. The iPhone bug: typographic glitch

{% asset double-space.gif alt="Double space" %}

I know putting two spaces after a punctuation is kind of a debate in the US, but
wait a minute, [no it isnâ€™t][2]. And certainly not within a date, nor in French.

## #3. The Apple Watch bug: maths horror

So, 13 â‰¤ 12 â‰¤ 20? ðŸ˜±

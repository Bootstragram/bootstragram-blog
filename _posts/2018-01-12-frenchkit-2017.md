[FrenchKit](http://frenchkit.fr) 2017 was awesome. I recommend it to any
iOS/Swift developer around.

I wrote many notes during the two days of the conference but I forgot to process
them right afterwards when things were still fresh. Bummer.

Finally, I went through the notes today and decided to make a blog post out of
them anyway. Raw and undetailed, 2018-style!

## My favorite talks

- [Playground Driven Development](https://youtu.be/DrdxSNG-_DE) by Brandon
  Williams (quite more detailed than the
  [objc.io](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E51-playground-driven-development-at-kickstarter)'s
  one)
- [May the Code Review Be with You](https://youtu.be/e9NI5XnEqHA) by Egor
  Tolstoy
- [You Deserve Nice Things](https://youtu.be/3ia3ngqM2mM) by Soroush Khanlou
- [Core Data Custom Store](https://youtu.be/dYWE2d4_IPY) by Rew Islam
- [Scaling Open Source Communities](https://youtu.be/WM6WECv4B2E) by Felix
  Krause

Side note to mention that a big theme of the conference was **code generation**.
It was frenquently quoted as something you should try out and be ready to use
when relevant. I'm in.

## What could be improved next time?

### France, we need to become better public speakers

As you can see above, not a single French speaker made it to my favorite talks.
This is hard to explain but for some reasons, French speakers are often nervous,
awkward or even uncharismatic. I rarely gave public talks but when I did, these
all applied to me as well. Not sure where this is coming from but fellow French
developers, we need to address this! 🇫🇷💪

### Let's be better with jokes

I'm sick of jokes filled of condescending notes.

> Core Data sucks _(audience laughs)_

Or:

> Cocoapods sucks _(audience laughs)_

I don't remember the exact jokes but I felt some were patronizing and
misleading. Core Data and Cocoapods are awesome tools. They have flaws but
nobody should be embarassed using them.

Also, enough with cat memes. As most overused material, they lost everything
that made them cool/cute/funny in the first place.

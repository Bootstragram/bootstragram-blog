GitHub Actions are powerful tools and a great complement to Xcode Cloud for
Swift projects' continuous integration.

However, I encountered an issue: when using `xcodebuild test` for iOS, a
_concrete device_ is required:

```sh
Cannot test target ‚ÄúFooTests‚Äù on ‚ÄúAny iOS Device‚Äù: Tests must be run on a concrete device
```

The challenge then arose: how to identify the simulator identifiers suitable for
the intended device?

Of course, Apple provides a command for this:

```sh
xcrun simctl list devices available
```

But then CI requires parsing and filtering on this command's output. Here are 3
solutions to do so.

## Fastlane era

Fastlane provides a `FastlaneCore::DeviceManager` that greatly assists in
inspecting available devices.

```ruby
require 'fastlane_core/device_manager'

# Usage: latest_simulator_with_name('iPhone X Ä').udid
def latest_simulator_with_name(device_name)
  result =
    FastlaneCore::DeviceManager.simulators
                               .select { |s| s.name == device_name }
                               .max_by { |s| Gem::Version.create(s.os_version) }
  return result unless result.nil?

  FastlaneCore::UI.error "#{device_name} missing. Please select one of the following:"
  FastlaneCore::DeviceManager.simulators
                             .each { |s| FastlaneCore::UI.message "#{s.name} (#{s.os_version})" }
  raise "Device with name #{device_name} cannot be found. Please install it."
end
```

Despite my extensive use of Fastlane, I'm starting to perceive a decline in its
relevance with the emergence of Xcode Cloud.

## Exploring the PointFreeCo Approach

As an admirer of the PointFreeCo team's work, I investigated their methods and
discovered [a useful yet succinct shell command][1].

```makefile
PLATFORM_IOS = iOS Simulator,id=$(call udid_for,iOS 17.2,iPhone \d\+ Pro [^M])

‚Ä¶

define udid_for
$(shell xcrun simctl list devices available '$(1)' | grep '$(2)' | sort -r | head -1 | awk -F '[()]' '{ print $$(NF-3) }')
endef
```

While efficient, it lacks readability.

## Implementing a Swift Solution

To address this challenge, I developed a Swift script to obtain the necessary
information. You can find [the script on the Scripts section of my Blocks
project][2] or as [a command of the CLI][3] that I provide with this tool.

To use it in continuous integration (CI), follow these steps:

```shell
# Download the script and make it executable
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirtyhenry/swift-blocks/main/Scripts/ListDevices.swift \
  -o findDevice
chmod +x findDevice

# Find the device identifier
DEVICE_ID=$(./findDevice $TEST_IOS_VERSION $TEST_IOS_SIMULATOR_MODEL)

# Run the test
set -o pipefail && xcodebuild test \
    -skipMacroValidation -skipPackagePluginValidation \
    -workspace foo.xcworkspace \
    -scheme "bar" \
    -destination platform="iOS Simulator,id=$DEVICE_ID" \
    | xcpretty
```

üí° I recommend setting `TEST_IOS_VERSION` and `TEST_IOS_SIMULATOR_MODEL` as
environment variables so that failures after Xcode updates can be resolved
without changing the code.

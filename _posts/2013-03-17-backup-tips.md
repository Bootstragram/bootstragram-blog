# 7 tips to create a safe and consistent backup strategy as a Mac user

I've recently found myself in a very uncomfortable situation: my backup external
hard drive (HDD) failed! I've suddenly realized my hot tea-cup was really close
to my MacBook Pro. I drank my tea, put my laptop in a safe and started thinking
about my backup strategy. Was it safe enough? I did a bit of research on the 
Internet and here are the results: 7 tips to create a safe and consistent backup
strategy as a Mac user.

## 1. Start backing up with Time Machine...

Time Machine is just great. Introduced in Mac OS X since Leopard (almost 4 years 
already), Time Machine is a great way to back up your Mac on an external HDD. 
It is fast to set up, convenient to use, smart when dealing with storage space. 
If you're a Mac user and don't use Time Machine, just start using it right now. 
Get an external HDD with a little bigger storage than your computer's and go 
ahead (for instance, I have a 320 Go HDD on my laptop and use a 500 Go HDD for 
Time Machine).

## 2. ... and back up your Time Machine backup

If you're a nomad user, you want to have your main Time Machine HDD with you all 
the time. What happens if your bag gets stolen? A Time Machine backup is not enough. 
You want another backup that you're gonna keep away from your laptop most of the 
time, and that you'll never carry away with both your computer and your primary 
Time Machine HDD. You could use Time Machine to make this other backup too but 
I don't recommend doing that. It makes Time Machine less convenient to use (you'll 
need to manually tell Time Machine you want to switch) and you'll end up having two 
Time Machine partially comprehensive backups rather than one consistent as 
comprehensive as can be backup.

In that case, you want to make a real copy of it. You don't need to do that everyday. 
Every week is enough. And you want to use the right software to do it, so maybe you 
should consider spending some money on a valuable software. Based on 
[Daring Fireball's advices][1], I've started using [SuperDuper!][2] 

It is reasonably priced ($27.95), easy to use and seems smart about what's being 
done (basic analysis of files, incremental backups). If someone knows other good 
software to do the same thing, please leave a comment about that.

## 3. Create a Media Center HDD...

With my laptop, I have a recurring problem: a lack of space in the internal HDD. 
To solve this permanently, I now try to keep my media files apart: music, photos and 
movies are on a dedicated external HDD. This strategy has many good points: you 
have a lot of space on your internal HDD (which is very convenient when you use 
your computer in a professional context), you have a mediacenter HDD you can bring 
to your friends' houses or that you can plug in a TV set, you can use it with a 
mediacenter server... It's very useful.

One disadvantage of this strategy is when your iTunes library is on this external 
HDD and you want to synchronize your iOS devices when your mediacenter HDD is not 
around. This requires a lot of manual work (sorting files you want to have in a 
minimized iTunes library and files you want to have in the extensive iTunes library). 
iOS 5 might help with this very soon.

## 4. ... and back up this Media Center HDD!

Now, what if this HDD fails? That's right, here comes SuperDuper! again. That's your 
3rd backup so far. You may think that's a lot but if something bad happens, you'll 
be glad for the little extra-money you'll have spent on those external HDD.

## 5. Forget CDs and DVDs

CD-RW and DVD-RW backups belong to ancient times. You don't want to do that anymore. 
They're really more fragile that we thought they were 10 years ago, they require 
a lot of work to keep track of what file's on which disk. Imagine you backup 
these files you cherish on DVD. If your primary files get corrupted for some reason, 
how will you remember where you stored it? How can you be sure the DVD hasn't 
quietly been damaged and became unreadable? Of course, HDD fail too but when they 
fail, they're not quiet. They let you know they died. HDD are a bit over-dramatic 
but you should be grateful they are.

## 6. Think of what you're backing up

I know storage is cheap. I know people can turn sentimental. But do you really 
need to backup [this animated gif image][3] that you thought was funny back in 2003? 
Delete it. Don't feel sad of the lack of backup. Keep on your HDD only the things 
that deserve to be backed up.

## 7. And one last tiny USB key backup for the road

On the opposite, some files are VERY important and you really don't want to lose 
them or you want them with you all the time. Just get a USB key and [build a safe encrypted backup][4] 
of files that really matter: password files, bank accounts files, critical professional documents...

Now I think you can feel safe about your data.

What's your backup strategy?

EDIT: [this alarming post][5] is another proof that backing up is very important. 
[Marco Ament's comments][6] are also very valuable.

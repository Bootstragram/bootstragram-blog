# bootstragram.com

Hi, I'm Mick. I'm a developer from Paris. Bootstragram is the home to my
professional and hobbyist software engineering adventures.

I sometimes share it with [zertyuio](https://github.com/zertyuio), who was my
associate when Bootstragram was turned into a company, from 2014 to 2017.

This repository contains [bootstragram.com][bootstragram]'s code.

It is about side-projects, iOS, Rails, JS, and whatever technical subject you
can meet when you're a developer.

## Installation

```bash
make install
make run

Bootstragram
============


This repository contains the sources of my [Jekyll-powered][jekyll] blog that is available online at [bootstragram.com][bootstragram].

The purpose of this blog is to share some technical adventures, notes and code relating to iOS, Ruby on Rails, etc. that could help other people as well.

Although I chose to disable comments, I do not intend to run this blog as a traditional blog as I'd like to keep the posts up-to-date and relevant. As such, I encourage readers to send any feedback via [Github][github-issues] or [Twitter][twitter], where discussion can be engaged in a more relevant way than with blog comments. I'll update the posts accordingly, giving credit to any hacker out there willing to help.

This repository only contains the data located under the `/blog/` subdirectory of the [bootstragram.com][bootstragram] website. Any other content found on the website is private and the license of this blog does not apply to it.

A pretty useful search tool of JavaScript operators.

As Josh W Comeau, its creator, puts it:

> This nifty little project lets you type in or select a JavaScript operator,
> and it tells you about it!
>
> I built this project because I was sick of forgetting what these blasted
> operators are called. Often I'll remember the operator's syntax, but not
> exactly how it works. I can't use search engines to find out more about them,
> since they ignore "special characters"!
>
> Perfect project to bookmark for when you need it.

Done. âœ…

_Lame No More_ was a project I started with my wife in April 2016. After feeling
we were losing touch with what was popular in music, we started this weekly
newsletter that was recapping the 10 most popular songs on YouTube, in a
countdown fashion. It has the nostlagia vibe of the French show _Top 50_.

It went on for 40 editions sent via Mailchimp.

As of 2022, a modern alternative to _Lame No More_ seems to be [the Spotify
Charts website][1].

`mfgridformobile` was a toolset for the SPIP CMS that included a theme and a
squelette featuring _fluid grids_, _fluid images_ and _media queries_ when these
were new, hot & sexy.

It also included optional features such as Feedburner (for RSS support), Twitter
and Google Analytics integration.

It also used the following third-party assets:

- This

- This other
  [_sketched icons set_](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/04/24-free-exclusive-vector-icons-handy/);
- I had used the iPhone app _ShakeItPhoto_ to apply some filter effects to all
  the image assets of the theme.

A SPIP website using `mfgridformobile` looked like this:

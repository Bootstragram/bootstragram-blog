## About

My name is Mickaël Floc'hlay.

* I do a lot of coding in multiple languages (Swift, JS, Rails, etc.);
* I try to convince people that they should listen to the same music as me on [Dead Rooster][deadrooster];
* [I compose and play music][livingstones].

I try to be as [agile][agile] as can be (though this word now sucks).

I’m French and currently based in Paris.

To find out more about me, [my LinkedIn profile page][linkedin] or [my Twitter account][twitter].
